## Project Overview
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. As the cyptocurrency market is highly saturated and volatile, we created a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. The intial data was not ideal, so the data had to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output, we decided to use _unsupervised learning_. To group the cryptocurrencies, we incorporated a clustering algorithm. Lastly, we used data visualizations to share our findings.

For the technical analysis of this project, we:
- Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
